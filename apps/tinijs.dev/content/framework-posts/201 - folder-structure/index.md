For a quick note about the term `Projects` in the **TiniJS** platform. Since the TiniJS platform is designed to be as versatile as possible, which means it is able to work with many favorite tools and other frameworks or no frameworks. Therefore, **a TiniJS project could be literally any project as long as it involves one or more TiniJS aspects**. For example: a Vue app using [Tini UI](/ui), a React app using [Tini Content](/module/content), a project using [Tini CLI expansion](/cli), ... More about interoperable will be discussed along the way with future articles.

For this article, we will focus on **projects involving an app built using TiniJS core framework**. That's being said, let explore TiniJS apps.

## Mandatory files

A TiniJS app may have any folder structure as you see fit for what you are comfortable to work with. But as a convention, I recommend you use the below structure for most of the case. At the very basic, an app **must have two files**:

| Item             | Description                                                                                                    |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| app/`index.html` | The entry point of the single page app, where you define: title, meta tags, includes fonts, init app root, ... |
| app/`app.ts`     | The `app-root` element is where you create a TiniJS client app, register config, setup router, setup UI, ...   |

## Suggested conventions

As your app grows, we will add different types of code, there are places for different things inside a TiniJS app, we can organize them into these files and folders:

| Item               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

When integrate with other tools and frameworks, the specific integrated code will live in its own folder at the same level as the `app` folder.
